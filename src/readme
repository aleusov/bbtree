Descriptions types of files:

buf.data This data we get from B&B solver or tree simulator. 
 
name          field's length  comment
time          12              
node's id     9               start from 1
parent        9               root node has empty parent(id = 0)
branch        2               That is child number. It starts from 1. Next child is predvious number + 1. 
state         1               See enum BBTree::NodeState
info          15              Any info

Note, 0 means empty value. There is not any node's id with value 0. 
There is delimiter | between fileds. There is '\n' at the end of each record.

buf_new.data (This file extends buf.data)

6 fields from buf.data      
left sibling  9
right sibling 9
first child   9
X coordinate  12
level         5               It starts from 0. Root node's level is 0. 
4 fields for tree layout:
prelim        12
mod           12
thread's id   9
ansector's id 9
            

depth.data (This file stores data about number of nodes for each level)

level         5            
nodes         9               Number of nodes for the level
list nodes    9               Number of list nodes for the level

1depth.data(This file stores node's id and X coordinate for level 1. See level in the file's name)

node's id     9
X coordinate  12             

l4depth.data (This file stores list node's id for level 4)

node's id     9
